JavaScriptâ€™s event loop is the core mechanism that enables asynchronous operations. 
Though single-threaded, it manages tasks efficiently. Imagine it as a queue system: events like user interactions or network requests are added to the queue, and the engine processes them one by one. 
This allows JavaScript to handle non-blocking tasks without freezing, keeping the application responsive even while waiting for data or other operations


1.Call Stack
2.Callback Queue:
3.Event Loop
4.Execution
5.Callback Execution

callback queue and job queue 

job queue are executed before the next rendering, I/O operation, or timer event



console.log('Start');

setTimeout(function() {
  console.log('Timeout');
}, 0);

Promise.resolve().then(function() {
  console.log('Promise');
});

console.log('End');
The output of the above code is as following

Start
End
Promise
Timeout
