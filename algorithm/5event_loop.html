JavaScriptâ€™s event loop is the core mechanism that enables asynchronous operations. 
Though single-threaded, it manages tasks efficiently. Imagine it as a queue system: events like user interactions or network requests are added to the queue, and the engine processes them one by one. 
This allows JavaScript to handle non-blocking tasks without freezing, keeping the application responsive even while waiting for data or other operations
