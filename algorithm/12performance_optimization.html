example:React Virtualized

2.Lazy Loading Images
The concept behind lazy loading is to initiate the load ow-resolution version of the image
he user scrolls or interacts with the page actual image is loaded dynamically,
example:react-lazyload

3.Memoization
caching the results of expensive computations

React.memo(), useMemo(), and useCallback()

4.Throttling and Deboucing Events

Throttling allows you to control the rate at which the function is called by setting up a minimum time interval between each function invocation. 
Debouncing allows you to postpone the function call until the user has finished typing or a specific time has elapsed since the last event.
With debouncing, the search function will only be invoked after the user stops typing for 300ms.

5.Code Splitting

6.React Fragments

7.web workers 
Web Workers serve as a solution to alleviate the burden on the main thread. They allow the execution of scripts in the background on a separate thread, distinct from the main JavaScript thread.
