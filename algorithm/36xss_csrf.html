Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is a Web application security vulnerability where an attacker tricks end-users into performing unwanted actions in which the user is logged in

The main purpose of XSS vulnerabilities is to steal the credentials of the victim. An XSS vulnerability is mainly a javascript technique. This vulnerability happens because of Developer didn’t pay attention to the user input filter.

Prevents:
1.Anti-CSRF Tokens: 
CSRF token should be:
Unpredictable with high entropy.
Tied to the user’s session.
Strictly validated in every case before the relevant action is executed.

2.Same Site cookies:

CSRF occurs when the victim clicks on attacker.com and the request goes to bank.com including victim session_id. That is cross-site communication when the request comes from a third-party site such as xyz.com and the request goes to abc.com.

so, what happens if we are not providing the session_id then they don’t have any chance to authorize and csrf prevents. That thing provides do same site cookie features.

example:
Set-Cookie: SessionId=NJCVnjnfCUrAfjoKkojDOOknKOkncKfmKDm; 
SameSite=Strict; 
Set-Cookie: SessionId=NJCVnjnfCUrAfjoKkojDOOknKOkncKfmKDm; 
SameSite=Lax;
