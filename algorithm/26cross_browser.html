1.Form Elements

Use CSS to standardize the appearance of form elements as much as possible.
For placeholders, ensure contrast and legibility across browsers:
example:
::placeholder { /* Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Safari 10.1+ */
    color: #909090;
    opacity: 1; /* Firefox */
  }

2.Fonts
Define a base font size in your CSS and use relative units (like em or rem) for text sizing as shown in the code below. This helps maintain scalability and consistency.
example:
html {
    font-size: 16px; /* Define a base font size */
  }
  
  body {
    font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;
    line-height: 1.6;
    color: #333;
  }
  
  h1, h2, h3, p {
    margin: 2rem;;
    padding: 1.5rem;
  }
  When using web fonts, ensure they are loaded properly across all browsers by using services like Google Fonts

3.Scrollbars 
example:
/* For Chrome, Firefox, and Edge */
scrollbar-width: thin;
scrollbar-color: #c0c0c0 #f0f0f0;
For Safari, which uses the WebKit rendering engine, you'll need to use the ::-webkit-scrollbar pseudo-element to achieve similar styling.

4.Define a Doctype
<!DOCTYPE> declaration to ensure standards mode is activated

5.Use a CSS Reset
Normalize.css, which you can install using a package manager like npm 

6.Review CSS Property Support

7.Create Responsive Websites
